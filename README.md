You are provided with a dataset from USA Forensic Science Service
which has description of 6 types of glass; defined in terms of their
oxide content (i.e. Na, Fe, K, etc). Your task is to use K-Nearest
Neighbor (KNN) classifier to classify the glasses.<br>

The original dataset is available at<br>
(https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/glass+identification).<br>

For detailed description on the attributes of the dataset,<br>
please refer to the original link of the dataset in the UCI ML repository.<br>

But the shared drive folder have the dataset for your convenience<br>

Perform exploratory data analysis on the dataset using Python Pandas,
including dropping irrelevant fields for predicted values, and
standardization of each attribute.<br>

Following data cleaning, two Scikit-Learn KNN models should be created
for two different distance metrics: Square Euclidean and Manhattan
distance. The performance of the two models using different distance
metrics should be compared in terms of accuracy to the test data and
Scikit-Learn Classification Report.
